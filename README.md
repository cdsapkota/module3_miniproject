Please run the main.py file.

This is the initial UI:
            Welcome to the Contact Management System! Menu:
            \n 1. Add a new contact
            \n 2. Edit an existing contact
            \n 3. Delete a contact
            \n 4. Search for a contact
            5. Display all contacts
            6. Export contacts to a text file
            7. Import contacts from a text file
            8. Quit

Please select an action to perform. The rest is pretty straight forward.
While importing contracts from the file, please make sure the file is in the same folder as main.py
